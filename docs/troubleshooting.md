# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you resolve common issues you might encounter when using AutoQML.

## Common Issues

### Installation Issues

#### Poetry Installation Fails

**Problem**: Poetry installation fails with dependency conflicts.
**Solution**:

1. Clear poetry cache: `poetry cache clear . --all`
2. Update poetry: `poetry self update`
3. Try installing with specific Python version: `poetry env use python3.9`

#### Package Import Errors

**Problem**: ImportError when importing AutoQML components.
**Solution**:

1. Verify your virtual environment is activated
2. Check installed packages: `poetry show` or `pip list`
3. Reinstall dependencies: `poetry install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Runtime Issues

#### Memory Errors

**Problem**: Out of memory errors during model training.
**Solution**:

1. Reduce batch size in neural network models
2. Use dimensionality reduction preprocessing
3. Limit number of parallel trials in optimization

#### Long Training Times

**Problem**: Model training takes too long.
**Solution**:

1. Reduce number of qubits in quantum circuits
2. Decrease number of circuit layers
3. Use simpler classical models for initial experiments
4. Enable GPU acceleration if available

#### Quantum Circuit Issues

**Problem**: Quantum circuit simulation errors.
**Solution**:

1. Verify quantum backend is properly configured
2. Reduce circuit depth and complexity
3. Check input data normalization
4. Verify measurement operators are properly defined

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Usage

- Use streaming data loading for large datasets
- Enable garbage collection during training
- Monitor memory usage with profiling tools

### Training Speed

- Use GPU acceleration when available
- Implement early stopping in neural networks
- Optimize quantum circuit designs
- Use parallel processing for classical models
